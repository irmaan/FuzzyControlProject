Utilizing Vague Rules for Process Control:
A Fuzzy Rule System Approach

Introduction
The aim of the first part of the fuzzy control project is to develop a fuzzy rule system for process controls, where both the conditions and decisions can be formulated vaguely. The usefulness of vague rules in complex process control lies in the fact that a sharp value of a variable can be activated for different rules to different extents, avoiding undesirably large consequences from small differences in parameters.
